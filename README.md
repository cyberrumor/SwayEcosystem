# Attention to Detail
- All parts of the interface are themed with pywal, not just terminal colors. This includes the bar, app launcher, notifications, and even the lock screen. 
- The app launcher and bar are the same height, so you won't notice any distracting or irritating graphic discrepencies. Notification padding has been adjusted to a precision of 1 pixel. 
- Light transparency brings grace to your interface without sacrificing legibility.
